The Client's Question (Business problem)
How much revenue is the client getting from external Search Engines, such as Google, Yahoo and MSN, and which keywords are performing the best based on revenue?

Development Requirements
1. Create a Python application that needs to be deployed and executed within AWS
2. The Python application needs to contain at least one class
3. The Python application needs to accept a single argument, which is the file that needs to be processed.
Bonus Points: Unit test cases, serverless deployment scripts, Business problem presentation


Deliverable Requirements
The final output needs to be a tab delimited file with the following data points:
• Search Engine Domain (i.e. google.com) • Search Keyword (i.e. "Laffy Taffy")
• Revenue (i.e. 12.95)


The final output also has the following requirements:
• A header row needs to be included. Use the above bulleted items for each column header, minus the example.
• Sorted by revenue, descending, so the client can easily review which keyword is performing the best.
• The output file should have the following naming convention: [Date]_SearchKeywordPerformance.tab
[Date] corresponds to the date the application executed for
The format should be YYYY-mm-dd (i.e. 2009-10-08)
